# Front-End-Practice

This repository contains a collection of front-end exercises built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. Starting in August 2025, I will be creating one front-end design per day as part of a daily practice challenge. You can see the results of the code in a file named *image.png* in each folder.


🎯 Goals

- Improve front-end development skills through consistent daily practice

- Build a personal library of reusable front-end components

- Document progress and learning along the way
  

🛠️ Tech Stack
